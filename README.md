==========================

Traffic delays are tremendously annoying and immensely wasteful.  For those of us commuting winding circuits through the world's larger metropolitan agglomerations, we experience these delays on a regular basis.  To cope, we generally spew epithets into the air, laced with the appropriate regional flavors of disgust and stress (also carbon dioxide).  While many of us have the computational wherewithal use Google Maps and its ilk to show us the current level of roadway suffering, solutions to our everyday commuting problems are far less ubiquitous.

What are these problems?  Whether we sit on our family room couches eating bowls of cereal while watching Mike & Mike in the Morning or sit in our office cubicles during the late afternoon, we are not interested in the question for which there are a plethora of answers: “what does the traffic look like now?” The real questions we, the commuters, have are twofold:
1.  What will the traffic be like at location x, in y minutes?
2.  If I leaver earlier or later, will my commute be materially improved?

To this end, we have developed a simple traffic-predictor, allowing users to see projected traffic conditions up to twenty-four hours in advance.  Better still, the estimates consider the current weather conditions, giving you the heads up when

Are the estimates perfect?  In a word, no.  Are they a significant improvement on the status quo?  We think so, and we'd love to hear what you think.
